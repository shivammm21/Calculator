# Simple Calculator using JavaScript

As we know, the Calculator is a portable device used in our daily life to perform various mathematical functions such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division,
root, etc. However, we have scientific or sophisticated calculators used to solve complex tasks such as trigonometry functions, degrees, exponential operators, log
functions, hyperbolic functions, square root, and so on. In this topic, we will create a calculator program in JavaScript.
